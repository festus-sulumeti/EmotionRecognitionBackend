1. For the first choice,
    this is the better option:

    pip install opencv-python
    pip install deepface
    pip install tf-keras

    the above is also in the readme guide file as 
    ```bash
        pip install Flask opencv-python deepface tf-keras
        ```



2. For the second following choice,

    if need be, as the last option install the following(if no need, then do not install the second one here below):

    ```bash
        pip install Flask opencv-python-headless opencv-python deepface tensorflow tf-keras
        ```

    - this second choice is as a result of minor error that may occur when running the code, if the first choice does not work, then try the second choice.
    
    
    
    
    
3. NOTE:
 I highly recommend the first choice, (which is what works best and is at the read me file also) but if it does not work, then try the second choice.


4. Ensure :

    Flask==3.0.3
    opencv-python==4.10.0.84
    deepface==0.0.93
    tensorflow==2.17.0
    tf-keras==2.17.0
